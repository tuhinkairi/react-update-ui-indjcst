                Advertising Policy:
            </Titleh2>
            <p className='mt-6'>

                The journal retains the authority to reject any advertisement it deems unsuitable
                for its mission or inconsistent with the principles of its members,
                publication/website, or organisation. Additionally, the journal reserves the right
                to discontinue accepting any previously received advertisement. All
                advertisements are subject to thorough scrutiny by the chief editor. No separate
                agreements with the journal and its subsidiaries shall override this policy under
                any circumstances [<span className='text-primary'>Ref 1</span>].
                <br />
                Advertising products or services related to alcohol, tobacco, weapons, firearms,
                ammunition, fireworks, gambling and lottery, and pornography or related
                themes is strictly prohibited. Moreover, advertisements that promote products
                using the term miracle or make health claims without proper evidence are not
                permitted. Promotions targeting children are strictly forbidden (<span className='text-primary'>Ref2, Ref3</span>).
                <br />
                Advertisers are required to provide evidence to support the claims they make. In
                cases where products fall outside the jurisdiction of the FDA or other
                government bodies, it may be necessary to submit technical and scientific
                documentation. The documents should be comprehensive, accurate, and
                credible and should be able to substantiate any claims made about the product.
                Products advertised with health claims that the FDA has rejected must include a
                disclaimer stating that the Food and Drug Administration has not
                evaluated (<span className='text-primary'>Ref2, Ref3</span>).This product does not intend to diagnose, treat, cure, or
                prevent any medical condition or ailment. Its use is not a substitute for
                professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. <br />
                To ensure transparency, advertisers must prioritise information-rich advertising
                and ensure that advertising icons and logos are distinguishable from editorial
                content [<span className='text-primary'>Ref2</span>]. It may be necessary to use specific labelling to provide clarity
                between them. <br />
                It is not allowed to intentionally place advertisements next to articles discussing
                the company or product advertised in professional publications [Ref 4].
                In the realm of online advertising, certain types of ads are strictly prohibited.
                These include Pop-ups and floating ads, which are intrusive and often disrupt
                the user experience. Additionally, any ad that collects personally identifiable
                information without explicit permission is prohibited. Ads that extend across or
                down the page without the user having clicked or rolled over the ad, as well as
                ads that redirect users to another site without their consent, are also off-limits.
                These rules are in place to protect user privacy and ensure a positive online
                experience for all. <br />
                The advertising policies are dynamic and may change without prior notification,
                as they are not exhaustive in their scope.
