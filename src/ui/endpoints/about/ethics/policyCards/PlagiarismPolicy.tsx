            <p className="mt-6">Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else’s prior ideas, processes, results
                or words without explicit acknowledgement of the original author and source. Self-
                plagiarism occurs when an author utilizes large part of his/her own previously
                published work without using appropriate references. This can range from getting the
                same manuscript published in multiple journals to modifying a previously published
                manuscript with some new data.

                The journal is strictly against any unethical act of copying or plagiarism in any form.
                Plagiarism is said to have occurred when large portions of a manuscript have been
                copied from existing previously published resources. All manuscripts submitted for
                publication to IJIRE are cross-checked for plagiarism using Turnitin/ iThenticate
                software. Manuscripts found to be plagiarized during initial stages of review are out-
                rightly rejected and not considered for publication in the journal. In case a manuscript is
                found to be plagiarized after publication, the Editor-in-Chief will conduct preliminary
                investigation, may be with the help of a suitable committee constituted for the purpose.
                If the manuscript is found to be plagiarized beyond the acceptable limits, the journal
                will contact the author’s Institute / College / University and Funding Agency, if any. A
                determination of misconduct will lead IJIRE to run a statement bi directionally linked
                online to and from the original paper, to note the plagiarism and provide a reference to
                the plagiarized material. The paper containing the plagiarism will also be marked on
                each page of the PDF. Upon determination of the extent of plagiarism, the paper may
                also be formally retracted.</p>

                <h3>The following types of plagiarism are considered by IJIRE:</h3>

                <p><span className="font-medium">Full Plagiarism:</span> Previously published content without any changes to the text, idea
                    and grammar is considered as full plagiarism. It involves presenting exact text from a
                    source as one’s own.</p>
                <p><span className="font-medium">Partial Plagiarism:</span> If content is a mixture from multiple different sources, where the
                    author has extensively rephrased text, then it is known as partial plagiarism.</p>
                <p><span className="font-medium">Self Plagiarism:</span> When an author reuses complete or portions of their pre-published
                    research, then it is known as self-plagiarism. Complete self-plagiarism is a case when
                    an author republishes their own previously published work in a new journal.</p>
