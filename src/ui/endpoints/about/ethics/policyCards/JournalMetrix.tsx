                Scholars and researchers count journal metrics to compare, gauge, and research
                impact and rank the quality and scholarly publications. These metrics, also
                known as journal rankings, journal impact, or journal importance, enable them
                to make informed decisions and comparisons regarding literary periodicals
                [Ref]. Such metrics are indicators of educational productivity, influence, and
                relevance in the academic community. Given the significance of journal metrics
                in academic circles, ensuring they are accurate, reliable, and transparent is
                paramount. As such, the use and interpretation of journal metrics require careful
                consideration and scrutiny to avoid potential biases and misrepresentations.
                The original citation impact metric is the Journal Impact Factor, created in the
                1950s and available through Thompson Reutersâ€™ Journal Citation Reports.
                Various accessible journal metrics have recently been created,
                including SCILit, CiteScore, Google Scholar Metrics, SCImago Journal &
                Country Rank (SJR), and Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP).
