            <p className='mt-6'>Digital archiving is essential in ensuring that scholarly content, such as journal
                articles, remains safe and accessible to readers for a long time. Several
                archiving platforms provide secure content storage, including Internet
                Archiving, LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, and Zenodo repository. These platforms use
                advanced technologies to preserve digital content, such as creating multiple
                copies and distributing them to various locations, ensuring that data is always
                available, even if one copy is lost. The journal can rest assured that archiving
                platforms will preserve the articleâ€™s content for future generations to access and
                reuse. The journal uses archiving platforms like Internet Archiving, LOCKSS,
                CLOCKSS, and the Zenodo repository.
                The journal recommends authors to promptly self-archive and publish their
                articles on institutional repositories or websites. These practices can enhance
                article citation and facilitate productive author exchanges.</p>
