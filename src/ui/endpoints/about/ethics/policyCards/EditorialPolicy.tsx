                <p>
                     The Indian Journal of Computer Science and Technology (INDJCST) will do retraction of articles
                    when there are significant errors, Ethical concerns and fraudulent data in the published work.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Retractions are a way for journals to maintain the integrity of the scientific record. This can happen for
                    many reasons like plagiarism, falsification of data, Ethical violations, multiple submissions of articles
                    and authorship issues, etc.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Every retraction issued will lead to publication for providing a valid reason for it or sometimes an
                    author explanation is needed as well and we follow the <Link to="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines  " aria-label="cope retraction" className="text-primary">COPE Retraction guidelines</Link>. Please contact

                    Erratum

                <p>
                    It is a small error or mistake, typically one found in a printed work after it has been published. These
                    errors are specific errors such as typos, formatting, graphical changes, or spelling mistakes,
                    grammatical errors etc but do not alter the original findings of the research. Erratum occurs when the
                    publishers make mistakes instead of the authors, thus there is no fee associated with them for the
                    author. It is given by the editor production team and mistakes will be underlined and will be mentioned
                    in a separate section at the end of the print copy if the errors will be notified under a specific time
                    period.

                    associated with authors. If these changes are minor then can be rectified and the article will be printed
                    in another issue with correction if major errors are there will lead to some costing and proper

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The concept of authorship is understood in such a way that each author of the authorship of the
                    manuscript contributed to the research, in a certain part. In the event of doubts on the part of the
                    editors, which may be based on the inconsistency of the content of the manuscript, the
                    competences of one of the authors in the field of scientific interests, the editors can request from
                    the author team in a separate document data with the distribution of the contribution to the
                    research and preparation of the manuscript, with a separate emphasis on the author&#39;s
                    contribution , about which doubts arose.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    An author-correspondent is selected from the composition of the author&#39;s team, who interacts
                    with the editorial office. He is responsible for turning the manuscript into an article and its
                    subsequent publication, as well as at the stage after the publication of the article, if such a need
                    arises. If there is a reasoned necessity on the part of the authors to remove or add co-authors, or
                    to change the order of authors, such changes after submission of the manuscript are possible
                    with the approval of the corresponding author.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The authorship identification process also involves preventing the appearance of ghost authors
                    and guest authors as part of the author’s team.

                    later, would make a reasonable reader feel misled or deceived. They may be personal, commercial,
                    political, academic or financial.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    It is normal to present the results of the author’s research in the conference proceedings
                    regardless of whether the paper was presented, accepted or published. Indeed, this is common
                    practice in many fields. In general, copyright law applies to the original expression of ideas, it
                    may restrict an author from distributing a paper in a conference proceedings, it does not prohibit
                    an author from creating a new presentation using ideas from this manuscript. The journal would
                    do well to explain what the authors mean by the notion of  “full text”.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It would be prudent if authors did not share an unpublished manuscript with the conference
                    committee to prevent erroneous duplicate publication. Authors should also consider what
                    materials, figures, tables, etc. they would be happy to share before publication and in what
                    format.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It would also be good practice for authors to indicate in the paper that the results were presented
                    in part (or in full) in conference proceedings.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    According to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), ethical oversight should include, but is not
                    limited to, policies fee on consent to publication, publication on vulnerable populations, ethical
                    conduct of research using animals, ethical conduct of research using human subjects, handling
                    confidential data and ethical business/marketing practices.
                    <br />
                    For studies involving data relating to human or animal experimental investigations, appropriate
                    institutional review board approval is required and should be described within the article. For
                    investigations involving human subjects, authors should explain how informed consent was obtained
                    from the participants involved. Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed without
                    informed consent. Identifying information should not be included unless the information is essential for
                    scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or legal guardian) gives written informed consent for
                    publication. When informed consent has been obtained it should be indicated in the manuscript. In
                    attempting to maintain patient anonymity, identifying details should be omitted where they are not
                    essential. However, patient data should never be amended or falsified. Informed consent should be
                    obtained whenever there is any doubt that anonymity can be assured.
                    <br />
                    Ethics approval for all studies must be obtained before the research is conducted. Authors must be
                    prepared to provide further information to the journal editorial office upon request

                    not include VAT or local taxes) must be paid by the authors, their institution, or funder before the
                    paper is made publicly available. Authors whose papers get accepted for publishing will be notified of
                    the approval and the outstanding payment. Please note that papers will not be published until the
                    APC is paid.

                    Duplicate Submission
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Authors should not submit the same manuscript, in the same or different languages, simultaneously to
                    more than one journal. The rationale for this standard is the potential for disagreement when two (or
                    more) journals claim the right to publish a manuscript that has been submitted simultaneously to more
                    than one journal, and the possibility that two or more journals will unknowingly and unnecessarily
                    undertake the work of peer review, edit the same manuscript, and publish the same article

                    Duplicate and Prior Publication
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Duplicate publication is publication of a paper that overlaps substantially with one already published,
                    without clear, visible reference to the previous publication. Prior publication may include release of
                    information in the public domain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Readers of journal deserve to be able to trust that what they are reading is original unless there is a
                    clear statement that the author and editor are intentionally republishing an article (which might be
                    considered for historic or landmark papers, for example). The bases of this position are international
                    copyright laws, ethical conduct, and cost-effective use of resources. Duplicate publication of original
                    research is particularly problematic because it can result in inadvertent double-counting of data or
                    inappropriate weighting of the results of a single study, which distorts the available evidence.
                    When authors submit a manuscript reporting work that has already been reported in large part in a
                    published article or is contained in or closely related to another paper that has been submitted or
                    accepted for publication elsewhere, the letter of submission should clearly say so and the authors
                    should provide copies of the related material to help the editor decide how to handle the submission.
                    Authors who choose to post their work on a preprint server should choose one that clearly identifies
                    preprints as not peer-reviewed work and includes disclosures of authors’ relationships and activities. It
                    is the author’s responsibility to inform a journal if the work has been previously posted on a preprint
                    server.

                </h3>
                <p>
                     The Indian Journal of Computer Science and Technology (INDJCST) is having
                    ISSN NO: 2583-5300 (Online), Bi-monthly international journal for publication of new ideas founded
                    by academicians, educationist, engineers and corporate people. The research results and FDRP
                    advancement are all aspects of Innovative Research in Advanced Engineering & Technology and
                    various engineering disciplines, etc. INDJCST is a scholarly open access, Single Peer Review Journal
                    which helps to academic person as well as student community. INDJCST provides the academic
                    community and industry for the submission of original research and applications related to Various
                    Engineering discipline and Advanced Technologies by FDRP Publications, TFDRP il Nadu, India
                    since year 2020
                    <br />
                    Reviewers play a central role in scholarly publishing. INDJCST uses Single peer review process,
                    which means that both the reviewer(s) and author(s) identities are concealed from the reviewer(s),
                    and vice versa, throughout the review process. This means that the reviewer(s) of the paper won’t get
                    to know the identity of the author(s), and the author(s) won’t get to know the identity of the
                    reviewer(s). Peer review helps validate research, establish a method by which it can be evaluated,
                    and increase networking possibilities within research communities. Despite criticisms, peer review is
                    still the only widely accepted method for research validation.
                    <br />
                    All submitted papers will be reviewed by Single peer review process which may take minimum 01 to
                    03 weeks from the date of submission. We are advising to all the author(s), do not submit sFDRP e
                    paper to the multiple journals. You should wait for review status of paper.
                    <br />
                    INDJCST is committed to prompt evaluation and publication of fully accepted papers. To maintain a
                    high-quality publication, all submissions undergo a rigorous review process. Characteristics of the
                    peer review process are as follows:
                    <br />
                    Simultaneous submissions of the sFDRP e manuscript to different journals will not be tolerated.
                    Manuscripts with contents outside the scope will not be considered for review.
                    <br />
                    Papers will be refereed by at least 3 or 4 experts (reviewers) as suggested by the editorial board in
                    which 01 from India and rest 02 or 03 from overseas.
                    <br />
                    In addition, Editors will have the option of seeking additional reviews when needed.
                    <br />
                    Authors will be informed when Editors decide further review is required. All publication decisions are
                    made by the journal’s Editors-in-Chief on the basis of the referees’ reports (reviewers report).
                    Authors of papers that are not accepted are notified promptly.
                    <br />
                    All submitted manuscripts are treated as confidential documents. All submitted papers will be
                    reviewed by double blind review process.
                    <br />
                    All manuscripts submitted for publication in INDJCST cross-checked for plagiarism software.
                    Manuscripts found to be plagiarized during initial stages of review are out-rightly rejected and not
                    considered for publication in the journal.
                    <br />
                    In case if a manuscript is found to be plagiarized after publication, the Editor-in-Chief will conduct
                    preliminary investigation, may be with the help of a suitable committee constituted for the purpose. If
                    the manuscript is found to be plagiarized beyond the acceptable limits, the journal will contact the
                    author’s Institute / College / University and Funding Agency, if any.

                    Erratum is an error that affects the accuracy of the published paper, and the
                    reputation of the authors. Errata are published as distinct articles. INDJCST publishes
                    errata in the case of a serious mistake or a factual error or omission in the methods,
                    results, or conclusions. To warrant an erratum, the scientific error must be serious
                    enough to affect the scientific content of the article and interpretation of results.

                    considerable errors that appear in online articles when these errors considerably
                    affect the content or understanding of the work reported (e.g., error in data
                    presentation) or when the error affects the publication’s metadata (e.g., misspelling
                    of an author’s name). In these cases, INDJCST will publish a correction that will be
                    linked to the original article.
                    Furthermore, INDJCST assumes authors inform the editorial office of any errors they

                    The INDJCST of Fifth Dimension Research Publication invites submissions from historically
                    marginalised scholars within the academic landscape, encompassing a broad spectrum of individuals
                    whose viewpoints and experiences, shaped by their geographic backgrounds, institutional affiliations,
                    gender identities, (dis)abilities, language proficiency, and various other distinctive characteristics, are
                    of immense value to our academic community. The journal is deeply committed to fostering an
                    inclusive environment that amplifies a rich tapestry of diverse voices and perspectives, providing a
                    vital platform for those whose narratives may often go unheard in traditional academic circles.

                    The INDJCST of Fifth Dimension Research Publication (FDRP) is committed to fostering equitable
                    opportunities that embrace and honour the diversity inherent in all individuals, regardless of gender,
                    ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, religion, or socioeconomic status. The journal stands against any
                    forms of bias, discrimination, and racism, striving to foster an environment where everyone feels
                    valued and respected. The Editor-in-Chief is deeply committed to these principles, ensuring they are
                    integrated into every aspect of editorial practices, including a thorough and transparent approach to
                    article submissions and a rigorous peer-review process, all aimed at cultivating a fair and inclusive
                    academic community. Through these efforts, the journal seeks to promote dialogue and
                    understanding among diverse perspectives, inspiring scholars, including historically marginalised
                    ones, to contribute and enrich the scholarly landscape.
