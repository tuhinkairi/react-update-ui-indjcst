      <h2>To maintain fair practice we at FDRP Publications strongly believe in following these

        <span className="text-primary">International Journal of Innovative Research in Engineering</span> is committed to
        ensuring ethics in publication and quality of articles. Especially, International Journal
        of Innovative Research in Advanced Engineering is following the Code of Conduct
        as defined by the <span className="text-primary">Committee of Publication Ethics (COPE)</span>.
        These ethics include the editor following certain rules on relations with readers,
        authors, and reviewers as well as procedures for handling complaints. Conformance
        to standards of ethical behaviour is therefore expected of all parties involved:
        Authors, Editors, Reviewers, and the Publisher. In particular,

        <ul className="space-y-1 ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>Authors should present an objective discussion of the significance of
            research work as well as sufficient details and references.</li>
          <li>Authors should maintain accurate records of data associated with their
            submitted manuscript and supply or provide access to these data, on
            reasonable request. Authors guarantee that all data used in the article are
            real and authentic. Where appropriate and where allowed by employer,
            funding body and others who might have an interest, authors should deposit
            data in a suitable repository or storage location, for sharing and further use
            by others.</li>
          <li>Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical
            behaviour and are unacceptable.</li>
          <li> The authors should ensure that their work is entirely original, and if the work
            and/or words of others have been used, this fact has been appropriately
            acknowledged. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing
            behaviour and is unacceptable. Submitting the sFDRP e manuscript to more
            than one journal concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behaviour and
            is unacceptable. Authors should not submit articles describing essentially the
            sFDRP e re-search to more than one journal.</li>
          <li>Authors should acknowledge the financial support and help/guidance of
            others if appropriate.</li>
          <li>Authors should provide the disclaimer if appropriate.</li>
          <li>All co-authors should significantly contribute to the research. The
            corresponding author should ensure that there is a full consensus of all co-
            authors in approving the final version of the paper and its submission for
            publication.</li>
          <li>Authors are obliged to participate in peer review process.</li>
          <li>Authors should notify promptly the editor if a significant error in their
            publication is identified, and cooperate with the editor to publish an erratum,
            addendum, corrigendum notice, or to re-tract the paper, where it is deemed
            necessary.</li>
