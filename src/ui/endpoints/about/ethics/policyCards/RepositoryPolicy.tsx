                Authors are encouraged to deposit their research findings and associated data in
                publicly accessible repositories that adhere to established archiving, curation,
                and citation standards. By doing this, authors can ensure that their work is
                preserved for future use and can be easily searched and cited by their peers.
                The repositories store data in its original form, enabling optimal study,
                validation, and reuse. This approach ensures that the data is preserved in its
                purest form, allowing for accurate and reliable results. Such repositories are
                particularly useful in business and academic settings where data integrity and
                accuracy are paramount. By maintaining the data in its native form, researchers
                and analysts can work with the data more effectively, leading to better insights
                and outcomes.

                The journal highly recommends using repositories, including but not limited
                to Dryad Digita, Zenodo, and Figshare, to communicate research effectively.
                These repositories offer a secure, reliable, and easily accessible platform for
                sharing valuable research data with peers and the wider academic community.
                The utilization of repositories is an essential step towards promoting
                transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility of research results, which are
                fundamental principles in the scientific community.

                Authors must utilize a repository that meets specific criteria to ensure a
                successful peer-review process. Firstly, the repository must be anonymous to
                maintain confidentiality. Secondly, data should be publically accessible, and
                resources should be stable and suitable for all researchers working with the
                pertinent data types. These factors are essential in ensuring a professional and
                efficient review process that meets the highest standards of business or
                academic settings.

                Authors must deposit the corresponding data into the repository as part of the
                article submission process to the journal. If the associated data still needs to be
                deposited in the repository, it can be uploaded to Figshare or Dryad Digital
                during the article submission.
