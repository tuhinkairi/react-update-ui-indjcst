                    <p>
                        Publication of an article in the journal is not contingent upon the author's ability to pay the charges. Neither is acceptance to pay the handling fee a guarantee that the paper will be accepted for publication. Authors that may not be able to pay can request the editorial office to reduce the fee to an amount as per editorial office norms. We only accept payment of handling fee/processing charges after the manuscript has been accepted for publication.

                        Additionally, the Journal will provide a 50% reduction in any APCs when the author(s) of an article does not have the funding required to cover these charges and can provide one of the following to demonstrate this:
